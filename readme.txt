[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
The idea for this mod came from a topic titled [url=https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=547240.msg3882384#msg3882384]A Neat Way To Enhance A Board![/url], which wrote about a way to use an image in place of the board title.  This mod attempts to accomplish this objective with a minimum of changes to the forum software.

Please note that at this time, there is no automated way to upload images to the server.  You must upload them to a location underneath the forum folder and refer to them as relative paths.  In other words, if you upload it to [b]/forum/Themes/default/images/duh.png[/b], then you would type [b]Themes/default/images/duh.png[/b] into the board image field.

In [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Forum[/b] => [b]Boards[/b], there is a new field when modifying the boards:
o [b]Replacement Board Title image[/b]

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.14 and SMF 2.1 Beta 3, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

This mod does not require the [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4085]SVG As Image Attachment[/url] mod to be installed prior or after this mod.  Rather, if the mod has been installed, it will try to use the functions from that mod (as opposed to the built-in [b]getimagesize[/b] function).
